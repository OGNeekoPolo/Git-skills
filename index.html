    <h1>Nikolas Trabue</h1>
    <p>I am 26 years old and I was born and raised in Indianapolis, IN. Before I decided to take a step into the coding world, I spent a good deal of my work life in retail management. I took the leap of faith because I figured that it was time to do something that I really loved, so here I am.</p>
    <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
    <p>I would really love to learn as many languages as possible, especially Ruby on Rails</p>
